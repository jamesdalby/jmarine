JMarine - Display NMEA0183 data

## Overview

This application connects to an NMEA0183 source and displays a set of sailing-relevant information.
It is written using Flutter, and thus runs on all Flutter-supported platforms (iOS, Android, Linux, Mac, Windows, web).  
However, my testing to date is only Android and iOS.
